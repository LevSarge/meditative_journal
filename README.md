# My Meditative Journal

This is my Capstone Project for the Part-Time Foundations 2 class for DevMountain. Most of the ideas that went into this project, or rather what inspired me the most, has been the experiences I have had with meditation apps such as Calm and Headspace. Meditation has been a very useful tool for me for years now, but the principles that one can learn from it doesn't have to come with a price-tag. I wanted to offer a free alternative to these popular apps, all with the convenience of no ads or subscriptions, just the fundamentals and some tools for the user!
